# Hadoop CSV-to-XML

This repo contains source code for a simple example of using Hadoop to load CSV
data into MarkLogic as XML.

## Compile

To compile the code, make sure you have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 
installed, then:

    $ mvn package

If all goes well, Maven will create a target directory that contains 
csvtoxml-0.0.2.jar. 

## Running the job

This code is released in support of a blog post. See post for more information.
